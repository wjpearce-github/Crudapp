## Test

`This is like a code example`

```python
print("Hello World")
```


**This is in BOLD**

~~this is how you do a strikethrough~~

## **Shortcuts**
- cntrl + D will copy a highlighted line

- Double tap shift to search for things

- cntl + shift + f will search for things in 
the project and the preview 

- Highlight + shift +f6 will replace an thing everywhere instead of doing it
manually 

- Shift + Cntl + Arrows will move code up and down

- cntrl + tab to switch between windows 

- cntrl + w will select a word, cntrl + ww will select the whole function

- shift + cntrl will select txt faster

- cntrl + shift + v is the copy history

- cntrl + left click shows you where a function is defined

- Bottom right shows what branch and you can add branches from here
local (terminal) or remote (whats on github). File name changin from white 
to blue means changes have been made. 

- Use the git toolbar across the top (Rollbacks are handy)
